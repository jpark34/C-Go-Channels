# C Version of Channels from the Go Programming Language
This lab was meant to teach multi-thread safe programming. It focused aroudn the use of the pthread library in C. More specifically the pthread mutex and pthread condition variables. In Go a channel connects concurent go routines by sending values into the channel from one go routine and then receiving those values in another go routine. For this project the only files that I modified were the channel.c and .h files. The rest were given to me. I was able to create a blocking and non-blocking version of both the send and receive functions in the case that a buffer was being used. All implemented functions are multi-thread safe.
